# Stock Price Anomaly Detecion Model (LSTM)
A Stock Price Anomaly Detection Model focused on identifying irregularities in the daily closing prices of the S&amp;P 500 stock. Utilizes NumPy, Pandas, scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Tensorflow, and the LSTM algorithm for efficient data manipulation, visualization, and deep learning-based anomaly detection in the stock prices.

Long short-term memory network is a recurrent neural network, aimed to deal with the vanishing gradient problem present in traditional RNNs. Its relative insensitivity to gap length is its advantage over other RNNs, hidden Markov models and other sequence learning methods.
